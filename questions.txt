Given a TV remote, write a script that would give   directions to input some letters. Starting from the upper left-hand corner. If the buttons were in 3 columns, and you wanted to type "feed", you would want the output of the program to say "right, right, down, PRESS, left, PRESS, PRESS, left, PRESS"

Two phone interviews. Does a given file name match a single-star pattern?
index.html matches *.html
foo.txt does not match *.html

matches(“index.html”, “*html”) returns true

Given two sorted lists of ordered tuples, combine them into one such that overlapping ranges are merged. For example: [ (1,4) , (10, 15) , (20, 24) ] and [ (3, 5) , (16, 17), (21, 23) ] becomes [ (1,5) , (10, 15) , (16, 17), (20, 24) ]  

We have a schedular. Timer is available to the schedular. The clients of this schedular want to call this schedular with 2 parameters, 1) time interval in ms 2) callback function. The schedular will invoke specified callback function after specified time intevals. Design data structure and implement it.  

Addition of 2 big numbers (represented by 2 int arrays, assuming each integer can only be 0-9)
